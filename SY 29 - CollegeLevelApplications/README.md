# OS Algorithm Analyzer 

Problem Statement: In modern computing environments, understanding and selecting the most appropriate operating system (OS) algorithms for efficient resource management is essential. However, users often 
lack the tools and knowledge to evaluate and compare different OS algorithms effectively. To address this gap, we propose the development of an OS Algorithm Analyzer. This platform will 
provide users with an interactive environment to simulate various OS algorithms across different components, including process scheduling, memory management, disk scheduling, and deadlock
prevention/avoidance.

Data Structures Used: A variety of data structures are used throughout the project. Each data structure is selected based on its strengths in addressing specific requirements of different
memory management algorithms, resulting in overall efficiency and effectiveness in resource utilization.
-Arrays 
-ArrayList
-Queue
-Lists
-Sets
